INSERT INTO `Response` VALUES (1,'StudentVisaGeneric','A student visa, specifically the Tier 4 (General) student visa in the UK, allows international students to study at a registered educational institution in the UK. This visa is essential for non-EU/EEA nationals who intend to undertake full-time academic courses. To be eligible, applicants must have an unconditional offer from a licensed Tier 4 sponsor, prove they have enough money to support themselves and pay for their course, and demonstrate adequate English language skills.'),(2,'StudentVisaCost','The cost of a UK Tier 4 (General) student visa is £348 if you apply from outside the UK, and £475 to extend or switch to this visa from within the UK. In addition to the visa fee, applicants must also pay the Immigration Health Surcharge, which is £470 per year of study, allowing access to the National Health Service (NHS).'),(3,'StudentVisaRules','The rules for holding a Tier 4 student visa include attending classes regularly, progressing academically, and complying with the work restrictions (generally up to 20 hours per week during term time and full-time during vacations). Visa holders must not access public funds (benefits) and must register with the police if required. The visa is also tied to the institution, so changing the course or institution requires formal notification and approval from the Home Office.'),(4,'StudentVisaLength','The length of a Tier 4 student visa typically covers the duration of the course plus a short additional period (usually 4 months for courses longer than 6 months) to allow for graduation and preparation for departure or further studies. If a course extends beyond the original duration, students can apply for a visa extension from within the UK.'),(5,'StudentVisaAttain','To get a Tier 4 student visa, students must first receive a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) from their chosen educational institution. They must then complete an online application form, provide biometric information, submit financial proof (showing they can support themselves and pay for their course), and demonstrate English language proficiency. Applicants will also need to provide a valid passport and possibly other supporting documents like academic qualifications.'),(6,'StudentVisaApplication','The application process for a Tier 4 student visa includes obtaining a CAS from a licensed sponsor, completing the online visa application form, paying the application fee, and the Immigration Health Surcharge. Applicants must submit their biometric information and provide documents such as proof of finances, academic qualifications, and English language proficiency. Some applicants might need to attend an interview or provide additional information.'),(7,'StudentVisaRejected','If a student visa application is rejected, the applicant should first understand the reasons for rejection, which are usually detailed in the refusal notice. Common reasons include insufficient financial proof, lack of required documents, or failure to meet the English language requirements. Applicants can appeal the decision if eligible, reapply addressing the reasons for rejection, or seek legal advice for further steps.'),(8,'StudentVisaFamily','Students with a Tier 4 visa can bring their dependents (spouse/partner and children) to the UK if they are studying at a postgraduate level for at least 9 months or if they are government-sponsored. Each dependent must apply for a visa, and the student must show additional financial proof to support their dependents. Dependents can work in the UK, and children can attend school.'),(9,'StudentVisaHealth','Students on a Tier 4 visa are required to pay the Immigration Health Surcharge as part of their visa application, which entitles them to use the NHS. This includes general medical services but might exclude some treatments like dental or optical care, which may require additional payment or insurance. Having private health insurance can provide additional coverage and peace of mind.'),(10,'StudentVisaRenewal','To renew a Tier 4 visa, students must apply before their current visa expires, preferably within the last three months of their course. The renewal process involves filling out the relevant online form, providing biometric information, paying the application fee, and submitting updated financial proof and a new CAS from their institution. Students can continue studying while their renewal is being processed.'),(11,'StudentVisaAfterGraduation','After graduation, students on a Tier 4 visa can apply for a Graduate Route visa, which allows them to stay and work in the UK for two years (three years for PhD graduates). This visa does not require a job offer and is designed to help graduates gain work experience. Alternatively, graduates can switch to other visa categories, such as the Skilled Worker visa, if they meet the eligibility criteria.'),(12,'StudentVisaTravel','Students with a Tier 4 visa can travel in and out of the UK during their studies, but they must ensure their visa and passport are valid for re-entry. It\'s advisable to carry documents proving their student status and course enrollment. There are no specific travel restrictions, but prolonged absences might affect their studies and visa compliance'),(13,'StudentVisaAccommodation','While applying for a Tier 4 visa, students must provide proof of accommodation or sufficient funds to secure accommodation in the UK. They can live on-campus, in university-provided housing, or off-campus in private rentals. Students are not required to stay on-campus but must update their address with the university and the Home Office. Various accommodation options are available, and universities often assist international students in finding suitable housing.'),(14,'WorkVisaGeneral','A work visa allows non-UK nationals to work in the UK. The Tier 2 (General) visa is the most common type of work visa, which requires a job offer from a licensed UK employer and a certificate of sponsorship. The job must meet certain skill and salary requirements, and the applicant must demonstrate English language proficiency and sufficient funds to support themselves.'),(15,'WorkVisaCost','The cost of a Tier 2 (General) work visa is £610 for a visa lasting up to three years and £1,220 for a visa lasting more than three years. Applicants must also pay the Immigration Health Surcharge, which is £624 per year. Additional costs include the application fee for dependents and the priority service fee if faster processing is desired.'),(16,'WorkVisaRules','The rules for a Tier 2 (General) work visa include working for the sponsor in the job described in the certificate of sponsorship, not owning more than 10% of your sponsor’s shares (unless earning more than £159,600 a year), and not accessing public funds.
